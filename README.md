Learning Guava
==============

After so many years of using [Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) library I still find new things in it so 
I have decided to pick up [Getting Started with Google Guava](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book)
and go through every class in library and write some tests for it.

Tests are written in [Spock](http://docs.spockframework.org/).
